# Welcome to my ToDo-App ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Import project to your Local System

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SAHIL080603/ToDoApp.git
   ```

3. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   
4. Insatll development apk (Refer following expo documentation for development build)

   (https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?mode=development-build)


5. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```
6. Scan the QR that pop-ups in the terminal and you are ready to go

### Some of the challenges that I faced are as follows : 
1. Setting up environment, I know react but expo is new as well as exciting for me.
2. I'm familiar with SQL, but SQLite is new for me and setting it up in my project was fun.
3. Overall new syntaxes and unexpected errors made the development of this project really exploring.
